# Remove Twitter Modal

## What it does

This extension just includes:

- a content script, "remove-twitter-modal.js", that is injected into any pages
  under "twitter.com/" or any of its subdomains

This addon removes modal that appears after scrolling on twitter without authentication and also re-enables overflow: scroll on document
